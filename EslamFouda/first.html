                    <p>Tooth Clinic was established in 2006 serving the local community of Beaconsfield, Whitegum Valley and Fremantle, as well as the surrounding suburbs. The surgery started in 2000 as Central Ave Dental before permanently relocating to
                        the current premises. The surgery has been in the current location for over 8 years. Over the time, the surgery has serviced the local community of different background and ages. We have seen the changes in the suburb and surroundings
                        over the years. We have treated whole families and extended family. We pride ourselves on being able to assess and deliver the best possible treatment for the individual. Our highly experienced dental team of dentists and staff
                        are all committed to delivering high quality dental treatment in a friendly and relaxed environment. With that in mind, we have many in our team that can speak a different language including Chinese, Filipino and Russian. We look
                        forward to servicing all our new clients and loyal family and friends. Contact us for any friendly advice or treatment options.</p>
